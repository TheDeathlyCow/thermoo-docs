## Mods

Add the following to your gradle build script:

=== "`build.gradle`"
    ```groovy
    repositories {
        maven {
            url "https://jitpack.io/"
        }
    // Needed as Thermoo uses Cardinal Components
        maven {
            name = "Ladysnake Mods"
            url = "https://maven.ladysnake.org/releases"
        }
    }
    
    dependencies {
        // Your other dependencies
        // get version from Jitpack: https://jitpack.io/#TheDeathlyCow/thermoo
        modImplementation "com.github.thedeathlycow:thermoo:<VERSION>"
    }
    ```

=== "`build.gradle.kts`"
    ```kotlin
    repositories {
        maven {
            url = uri("https://jitpack.io/")
        }
        // Needed as Thermoo uses Cardinal Components
        maven {
            name = "Ladysnake Mods"
            url = "https://maven.ladysnake.org/releases"
        }
    }
    
    dependencies {
        // Your other dependencies
        // get version from Jitpack: https://jitpack.io/#TheDeathlyCow/thermoo
        modImplementation("com.github.thedeathlycow:thermoo:<VERSION>")
    }
    ```

!!! warning
    You may embed Thermoo in your mod through the `include` directive or other jar-in-jar mechanisms, provided that you follow the conditions of Thermoo's [LGPL-3.0](https://github.com/TheDeathlyCow/thermoo/blob/HEAD/LICENSE) license. This includes, but is not limited to: making your mod open source, and providing the same license in your mod (or [GPL-3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html)). See the full license text for all terms.

## Datapacks

You must first install either the [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) or [Quilt](https://quiltmc.org/) mod loaders to use
Thermoo. Thermoo may run on the NeoForge platform when using Sinytra Connector, however this usage is not supported.
Support queries and issues from users not using Fabric or Quilt will be closed/ignored.

Ensure Thermoo is installed in your `mods` directory, along with its
dependencies [Fabric API](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric) (
or [QSL](https://github.com/QuiltMC/quilt-standard-libraries/) if using Quilt)
and [Cardinal Components API](https://github.com/Ladysnake/Cardinal-Components-API).
