This <code>add</code> procedure is what applies temperature resistances so that mobs and players can counter environment exposure. These resistances are also controlled by attributes.</p> <p>When reducing temperature, the attribute <code>thermoo:frost_resistance</code> is applied. Similarly, when increasing temperature, the attribute <code>thermoo:heat_resistance</code> is applied. Each point of these attributes correspond to a <code>10%</code> reduction of incoming temperature change. So a Frost Resistance value of 1 will reduce the power temperature decreases by 10%, and a Heat Resistance value of 10 will reduce the power of temperature increases by 100%. These values can also be negative, making their corresponding temperature change worse.</p> <p>However, these resistances are only applied based on the mode of the temperature change.

This mode should be used when   some sort of targeted effect is applied to the entity, such as a freezing spell or being set on fire.</li> <li>The <code>passive</code> mode only applied the resistance when the target's temperature is in the relevant temperature range.

This mode   should be used when dealing with temperature changes from nearby blocks, like standing on Ice or the heat of a   Campfire.</li> <li>The <code>environment</code> mode is an internal mode that applies the environment resistance   attributes, <code>thermoo:environment_frost_resistance</code> and <code>thermoo:environment_heat_resistance</code>, to temperature changes   from the Environment API (see below).

In order to have a better sense of decorator application order when considering other mods, the event is implemented with a phased ordering as follows:</p> <ol> <li><code>Event.DEFAULT_PHASE</code>: The first and default phase of the event. Use this phase for setting base controller values that may be modified/overwritten later. Generally speaking, you can assume that the controller value will be 0. This phase does not need to be specified when registering event listeners.</li> <li><code>EnvironmentControllerInitializeEvent.MODIFY_PHASE</code>: The second phase of the event. Use this to modify the base values of the decorator.</li> <li><code>EnvironmentControllerInitializeEvent.OVERRIDE_PHASE</code>: The third phase of the event. Use this when you want to explicitly overwrite values from other mods.</li> <li><code>EnvironmentControllerInitializeEvent.LISTENER_PHASE</code>: The final phase of the event.
